        <p>Hey, my name is Nick! I am a Junior Front-End engineer looking to gain awesome experiences in the Tech Community. Checkout out my other pages and maybe one day we could get some coffee together :) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAIAABwj2dwBDU2CaJKqQWcrszl0EH5QuldzXA0&trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile_pic">Linkedin</a>. <a href="https://github.com/Reynoldsn">Github</a>. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coffeewithnick/">Instagram</a>.</p>
        <h2> Checkout our Capstone story </h2>
        <p> 9 weeks into the Iron Yard Code Camp, it was crunch time to choose an app idea for our final project. Peter had the following thoughts…
        “One idea had been floating in my mind for a few weeks now based on a problem I would run into traveling. At a basketball court in Hoi An, Vietnam, I’d go to play ball with my good friend Kevin. We are both 6 feet plus with some fairly legitimate basketball skills. While it was an absolute joy to compete against each other, when other players started to show up to fill the court, the level of the game would decrease dramatically, making play almost unbearable. How nice it would be to find others to play with at the same level.” -Peter
        Thus the idea for Skill-Match was born and expanded upon during our Friday afternoon Iron Pints. This idea can work not only for skilled opponents looking for other skilled opponents, but also for less skilled players looking for “fun” matches.
        </p>
        <p>
        In its infancy Skill Match was developed to match users with players of similar skill level in order to make the matches more competitive and appealing to the casual sportsman. The first weeks of working on Skill Match were functionality first which left our team with a working site and no design three days before our deadline, so after a few all nighters and countless redesigns Skill Match had finally taken shape. Even after weeks of coding our core concept of a helping our users find the games they wanted to play still show in the product.
        As we build with all of these technologies we have to come up with one thing and that’s the MVP! In the very beginning we had a two week deadline to get the MVP up and running. The MVP was kind of hard for us to come up with because we had so much we all wanted to implement into Skill Match but like we have done so well before we needed to come together and get App ready. To get this all ready we set up a Trello with many tasks in a day and one by one we would take on the Trello Board. We defined the MVP by creating a skeleton outline of the product. We also focused on icons for the site. Nick really wanted an Otter as a mascot for Skill Match but seeing the options that we got we had to re-consider the Otter :( but we push hard for a great MVP and were ready for the small break that we had ahead.
        The Holiday season was upon us and what was on our minds? Unfortunately it was not bright lights and candy canes. It was only, how can we keep pushing forward. Geolocation was our primary focus. If we could implement geolocation by new years, we felt like we’d be on a good pace. Another important step was to meet with a local Parks and Recreation representative. Chuck Ashby, the Outdoor Recreation Supervisor for the city of Henderson was gracious enough to bring us in for a meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
        Our meet at the Downtown Henderson Recreation center was a milestone for the project. It really changed our vision of what was possible. The three of us walked into the Rec center to see a large group of seniors and elder adults wielding paddles playing a competitive game called Pickleball. Chuck Ashby informed us the game is blowing up in popularity. They are even in the process of converting old tennis courts into Pickleball courts. He told us the major complaint he receives is players being matched against those way above or way below their skill level. Before this meet, we were trying to appeal to all sports everywhere. After this meet, we thought we could focus on the needs of the customer. In this case it’s Henderson Parks and Rec and the game of Pickleball. It was a little late to change the entire scope of our project, but it gave us plenty to think about going forward.
        Creating Skill Match was an awesome experience for all of us. The learning process was unbelievable as we all learned so much, not only as individuals but as a team! We learned that in order to build something great we need to take the time with each other and feed off the teams thoughts. So that’s exactly what we did, we came together as a team and created something more than we ever thought imaginable. Working as one, was the most important way for us to get through a very vigorous deadline and a even harder web app.
        </p>
        <p>
        As individuals we also had a incredible opportunity to learn so much more of the languages that we took the time to study for the past two months. Peter was in charge of the backend, creating a Django Rest Framework for Domingo and I to be able to GET, POST and PUT data to. Peter used Python, Django, Twilio, Sendgrid, PostGIS “Postgres”, Beautifulsoup4, Cloudinary and Geopie. While Domingo and Nick used HTML5, CSS, SASS, Backbone.js, Backbone Router, JQuery, Geolocation and Google Maps.

        <p>
        By the way, we got geolocation by New Years! Right on schedule…
        </p>
        There it is, the light at the end of the tunnel! One excruciating month of long hours, no sleep a ton of coffee and way too much pizza! We did it, we did what we set out to do in the beginning of the school and the early stages of what we wanted Skill Match to be. Building this app was a great experience for all of us not only to learn but to learn what it is like to be with a tech team. We are hoping to implement this product in the future with Parks and Rec in Henderson and can’t wait to keep working on this together.
